# Geocode Example
This example shows how to use geocoding in conjuction with Drag and Drop.

There is a list of address in the source. Drag this file on to the map. The lines will be run through the geocoder at [Albuquerque Open Data](http://coagisweb.cabq.gov/arcgis/rest/services/locators/CABQ_Composite/GeocodeServer)
This should work with any address in Albuquerque. Try it with your own addresses.
