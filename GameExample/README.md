# Creating a Game with Open Data
This application demonstrates simple game rules using a Leaflet.js map, Turf.js and [Albuquerque Parks](http://www.cabq.gov/abq-data).

##Using the Code
The application loads a map with park polygons. Double click the map to add a marker (player). Move any player to a park. If you move to far, you will be warned and placed at the last location. When you reach a park, you will be notified that you are in a park.

**Concepts**
*Load Open Data
*Add Marker
*Move Distances - constrained by zoom level because distance is in pixels
*Winning Conditions - Point in Polygon.

##To Do
To make the game functional, you would need to make it turn based and maybe add the points at the start randomly for each player. This is a start to demonstrate the possibilities.  Albuquerque Monopoly? Albuquerque Risk? Who knows.
